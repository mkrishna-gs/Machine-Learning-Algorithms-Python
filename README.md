# Non Regularized Linear Regression
In this work, I have developed a basic simple linear regression alogorith in Python using vectorized "gradient descent method" and liner regression using "Sci-kit learn" in python. Since, it is a simple algorithm there is no much difference in vectorized gradient and linear regression using sci-kit learn. In these codes, I have also calculated the "R2" score using the sci-kit learn and found the same in both these algorithms. But this will differ in both computation efficiency and accuracy as the data becomes more and more complicated.
